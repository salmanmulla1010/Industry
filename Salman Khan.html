        Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (Hindi: [salman]; born 27 December 1965) is an Indian actor, film producer, and television personality who works predominantly in Hindi films. 
        In a film career spanning over thirty five years, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two Filmfare Awards as an actor.
         He is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors of Indian cinema. Forbes has included Khan in listings of the highest-paid celebrities in the world, 
        in 2015 and 2018, with him being the highest-ranked Indian in the latter year.

        The eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan, Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), 
        followed by his breakthrough with a leading role in Sooraj Barjatya's romance Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). He established himself in the 1990s, 
        with several commercially successful films, including Barjatya's family dramas Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999), 
        the action film Karan Arjun (1995) and the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999). 
        After a period of decline in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by starring in top-grossing action films like Wanted (2009), Dabangg (2010), 
        Ready (2011), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dabangg 2 (2012), Kick (2014), 
        and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and dramas such as Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan (2016). Khan has starred in the highest-grossing Hindi films of 10 years, 
        the highest for any actor.

        In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human Foundation. He has been hosting the reality show Bigg Boss since 2010.
        Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. In 2015, he was convicted of culpable homicide for a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car,
        killing one, but his conviction was set aside on appeal. On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment.
         He is currently out on bail while an appeal is being heard.
